# Habitsphere
A New Dimension in Habit Building

## Project Overview

HabitSphere reimagines habit-building by creating an immersive and community-driven platform. Unlike traditional methods, HabitSphere leverages storytelling and AI-powered insights to transform habit formation into a transformative journey. The app utilizes a robust technology stack, including SQLAlchemy for database management, Flask for backend development, and Bootstrap or Vue.js for a user-friendly frontend.

## Objectives

* **Transform Habit Building:** Shift the focus from mere tracking to a narrative-driven experience that fosters emotional connection.
* **Create a Shared Journey:** Foster a sense of community through shared stories and experiences, making habit building a collective adventure.
* **Visualize Progress Creatively:** Utilize innovative visual metaphors and AI insights to represent progress in an engaging and less transactional manner.

## Unique Features

* **Story-Driven Habit Creation:** Users frame habits within personal narratives. For example, instead of "exercise," a user might frame it as "becoming a hero in their own adventure."
* **Dynamic Future Map with ChatGPT Integration:** 
    * Users access a visual map representing current habits and potential future skills.
    * The ChatGPT API generates personalized insights, illustrating potential future outcomes based on current habits.
* **Progress Bar Visualization:** A simple progress bar visually represents the strength of each habit, aiding in understanding commitment levels and tracking progress.
* **Community Story Sharing:** Users share their stories and experiences related to their habits, creating a library of inspiration and motivation.

## Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** Bootstrap or Vue.js
* **Backend:** Flask
* **Database:** SQLAlchemy (with SQLite for simplicity)
* **API:** ChatGPT for personalized insights and reflections
* **Deployment:** Heroku or a similar platform for quick deployment
